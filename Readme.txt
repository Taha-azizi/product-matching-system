Intelligent Product Matching: From Manual Mapping to Automated Solutions Using AI
How we transformed a tedious manual process into an intelligent system using vector similarity, LLMs, and prompt engineering

The Challenge: Matching Products at Scale
Imagine you're operating a chain of convenience stores, receiving weekly shipments with hundreds of new products from various suppliers. Your current process? Manually matching each external supplier product with your internal inventory system — a time-consuming, error-prone task that's crying out for automation.

This is exactly the challenge we tackled: developing an intelligent system to automatically match external supplier products with internal inventory items, where the match must be exact — meaning identical manufacturer, name, and size.

Understanding the Problem Space
The Data Landscape
We're working with two CSV files:

Internal product list: Your stakeholder's inventory system
External product list: Supplier shipment manifests
Success Criteria
The system must produce exact matches only. Consider these examples:

✅ Correct Matches:
External: DIET LIPTON GREEN TEA W/ CITRUS 20 OZ
Internal: Lipton Diet Green Tea with Citrus (20oz)

❌ Wrong Matches:
External: Hersheys Almond Milk Choco 1.6 oz
Internal: Hersheys Milk Chocolate with Almonds (1.85oz) (Different size!)
The Solution Architecture: A Multi-Layered Approach
Our solution employs a sophisticated pipeline combining multiple AI techniques:

1. Exact String Matching (Baseline)
The foundation layer performs direct string comparisons after normalization.

2. Fuzzy String Matching
Handles minor variations in formatting and spelling using algorithms like Levenshtein distance.

3. Vector Similarity Matching
Converts product descriptions into high-dimensional vectors, enabling semantic similarity detection.

4. Hybrid RAG with LLM Validation
The crown jewel: combines vector similarity with Large Language Model reasoning for intelligent decision-making.

5. Sequential LLM Calling
Implements a fallback mechanism where if the first LLM attempt fails, we try again with the next-best vector matches.

Vector Database Construction
# Convert product descriptions to embeddings
embeddings = embedding_model.encode(internal_products)
vector_db = create_vector_index(embeddings)

The Matching Pipeline
Step 1: Vector Retrieval For each external product, retrieve the top-K most similar internal products using cosine similarity.

Step 2: LLM Validation Pass the external product and candidate matches to an LLM with carefully crafted prompts:

prompt = f"""
You are a product matching expert. Determine if these products are EXACTLY the same:
- Manufacturer must be identical
- Product name must be identical  
- Size must be identical

External: {external_product}
Internal candidates: {candidates}

Return only the exact match or 'NO_MATCH' if none qualify.

Step 3: Sequential Fallback If no match is found in the top-K results, expand to the next-J candidates and repeat the LLM validation.

Key Parameters for Optimization
The solution introduces two critical hyperparameters:

K: Number of initial vector similarity matches to consider
J: Number of additional matches to evaluate if the first attempt fails
These parameters allow fine-tuning the trade-off between precision and recall.

Lessons Learned and Limitations
What Worked Well
Vector similarity effectively captured semantic relationships
LLM validation provided nuanced reasoning about product equivalence
Sequential calling improved match rates without sacrificing precision
Challenges Encountered
No labeled data: Evaluation relied on manual inspection rather than automated metrics
Strict matching criteria: The "exact match" requirement increased false negatives
Few-shot prompting: Surprisingly, this approach didn't improve results in our case
Areas for Improvement
Labeled dataset creation for proper model evaluation
Vector database optimization with domain-specific embeddings
Advanced prompt engineering techniques
Parameter optimization using systematic approaches
The Business Impact
This solution transforms a manual, hours-long process into an automated system that can:

Process hundreds of products in minutes
Maintain high accuracy through LLM validation
Scale effortlessly with business growth
Reduce human error and operational costs
Future Directions
The current implementation serves as a strong foundation for further enhancements:

Active Learning: Incorporate human feedback to continuously improve matching accuracy
Custom Embeddings: Train domain-specific models on retail product data
Multi-modal Matching: Include product images and additional metadata
Real-time Processing: Deploy as a streaming service for live inventory updates
Conclusion
By combining the semantic understanding of vector similarity with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, we've created an intelligent product matching system that significantly outperforms traditional rule-based approaches. While challenges remain, particularly around evaluation and parameter optimization, this hybrid approach demonstrates the power of combining multiple AI techniques to solve real-world business problems.

The key insight? Sometimes the best solution isn't choosing between different AI approaches — it's orchestrating them together in a way that leverages each technique's strengths while compensating for their individual weaknesses.

This solution showcases how modern AI techniques can transform traditional business processes, moving from manual operations to intelligent automation while maintaining the precision required for critical business functions.
