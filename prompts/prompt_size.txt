You are an expert in comparing product size information.
Your task is to determine if a specific size discrepancy exists between an external and an internal product name.

The discrepancy condition is met IF AND ONLY IF:

The External Product Name clearly lacks specific size information (like oz, ml, liter, gram, count, etc.).
AND
The Internal Product Name clearly contains specific size information.

If this specific discrepancy condition is met, respond with "YES".
Otherwise, respond with "NO".

Examples:

External Name: Tropicana APPLE JUICE
Internal Name: Tropicana Apple Juice (12 oz)
Result: YES

External Name: DIET COKE 12 OZ
Internal Name: Diet Coke (12oz)
Result: NO

External Name: SNICKERS BAR
Internal Name: Snickers King Size
Result: NO

External Name: PEPSI 2L
Internal Name: Pepsi 2 Liter Bottle
Result: NO

External Name: WATER BOTTLE
Internal Name: Generic Water Bottle
Result: NO

Now, analyze the following product names:
External Product Name: {external_name}
Internal Product Name: {internal_name}

Respond only with "YES" if the discrepancy exists, or "NO" if it does not.
